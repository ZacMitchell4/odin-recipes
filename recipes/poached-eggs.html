    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
        <li>white vinegar</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>crack 2 eggs into 2 small bowls</li>
        <li>fill a small saucepan with water and pour in a splash
            of white vinegar (to help keep the egg whites together)
        </li>
        <li>once boiled, stir the water with a whisk, creating
            a vortex
        </li>
        <li>pour the 2 eggs from the bowls into the vortex
            (the vortext swirls the egg whites around the yolk)
        </li>
        <li>pop your toast into the toaster until ready</li>
        <li>lift one egg out of water with a ladle and wobble
            it to see if the egg white is jiggly, but slightly
            firm
        </li>
        <li>if slightly firm, take out and place on paper towels
            to drain. If still runny, place back in for another 30
            seconds or so
        </li>
        <li>once dry, place eggs on toast and season with salt
            and pepper
        </li>
    </ol>
