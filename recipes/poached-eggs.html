			be poaching the best eggs this side of the mississippi.

	<h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
	<ul class="text-font">
		<li>2 eggs</li>
		<li>2 slices of sourdough bread</li>
		<li>white vinegar</li>
		<li>salt and pepper</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
	<ol class="text-font">
		<li>crack 2 eggs into 2 small bowls</li>
		<li>fill a small saucepan with water and pour in a splash
				of white vinegar (to help keep the egg whites together)
		</li>
		<li>once boiled, stir the water with a whisk, creating
				a vortex
		</li>
		<li>pour the 2 eggs from the bowls into the vortex
				(the vortex swirls the egg whites around the yolk)
		</li>
		<li>pop your toast into the toaster until ready</li>
		<li>lift one egg out of water with a ladle and wobble
				it to see if the egg white is jiggly, but slightly
				firm
		</li>
		<li>if slightly firm, take out and place on paper towels
				to drain. If still runny, place back in for another 30
				seconds or so
		</li>
		<li>once dry, place eggs on toast and season with salt
				and pepper
		</li>
	</ol>
